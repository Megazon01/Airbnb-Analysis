# Airbnb Analysis

This project was created for fun using data publically available. The purpose of this project was to analyze data for New York Airnbs and determine which factors affect user ratings the most. The result was the dashboard 
created below. For the full interactive version click [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/petros.zonias/vizzes).

## Key Findings
**IMPORTANT FACTORS AFFECTING USER RATINGS:**
- Privacy during stay
- Safety
- Cleanliness
- Host Attitude

**FACTORS NOT AFFECTING USER RATINGS**
- Price
- Neighbourhood
- Property type (as long as safety and cleanliness are satisfied)
- Host past experience

**INTERPRETATION:**
Unexpectedly, price did not affect average user ratings. The only two variables that seemed to matter in the analysis were Zipcode and Property Type. Through further research, I found that
common reasons given for negative reviews are the ones listed above, and this analysis suggests that Zipcode and Property Type might be correlated with factors such as safety, privacy and cleanliness for example.
